Bitwise Operators 

1. AND  (&&) 
2. OR   (||)
3. NOT  (~)
4. XOR  (^)

1 -> AND :- when AND operator is operated on two values then it return 1 when both the values are 1 or true and if even one value is false or 0 it will return false or 0. 

example
    a       b        (a && b)
    0       0           0
    0       1           0
    1       0           0
    1       1           1

2 -> OR:- OR operator returns true or 1 even if one of the value is true 
example
    a       b        (a || b)
    0       0           0
    0       1           1
    1       0           1
    1       1           1

    and if both are true then obviously 1 as it needs only one true value both true acts as bonus only . 

3 -> NOT :- NOT operator gives reverse of the given input if the input is 0 it will return 1 and if the input in 1 it will return 0. 

example
    a        (a ~ b)
    0           1
    1           0


4 -> XOR :- On same values it will return 0 and on different values it will return 1 . 

example
    a       b        (a ^ b)
    0       0           0
    0       1           1
    1       0           1
    1       1           0
